IoT-Controller Mobile Application

This Mobile Application is a demo app which is used a remote control for a simple electrical component. When a user triggers a particular button i.e., ON/OFF
the respective status of that button will be communicated with database which is existing in firebase console. 

There the particular status is again triggerd by our microcontroller(NODE MCU WIFI MODULE) and helps to communicate with the hardware component and enables it to switch ON/OFF.

File==> `arduino code.ino` in this repository is the equvivalent code for the microcontroller logic.
